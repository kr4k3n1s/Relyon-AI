2. Wine is composed of wine is composed of water, ethanol (alcohol), glycerol, higher alcohol, and polysaccharides (sugar), organic acids, polyphenols such as anthocyanin and tannin, minerals, volatile compounds, and other compounds like sulfite.
3. To produce wine I will need this base ingredients: grapes, water, sugar
4. I see that user suffers from red rash.

Output: 
    food: ["wine"],
    composition: ["water","ethanol","alcohol","glycerol","polysaccharides","sugar","organic acids","acids","polyphenols","anthocyanin","tannin","minerals","sulfite"],
    symptoms: ["rash","red rash"]
